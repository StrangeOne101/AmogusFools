# AmogusFools
Spawns an among us behind you and plays the among us meme music. That's it. Happy april fools!

The among us is made of Block Marker particles, so it can spawn in any direction. The music plays an NBS (Note Block Studio) file to play the theme song.

You can hear the music by listening to the mp3 version [here](https://github.com/StrangeOne101/AmogusFools/blob/master/amogus.mp3?raw=true)
